# Reddit Post for r/Piracy

## Title

"Spent 5 months mass-producing poor decisions and accidentally made something useful. Open source, ad-free, works everywhere."

## Post

Five months ago I made the mistake of thinking "I wonder how these sites actually work under the hood."

I could not stop.

### What I Built

**Flyx** - a frontend that doesn't try to give your browser cancer:

- Ad-free, popup-free, no crypto miners
- Clean UI that doesn't assault your eyes
- Works on phone, desktop, tablet, whatever
- No account needed, no email harvesting
- Runs entirely on free hosting
- Open source on GitHub

### The Technical Rabbit Hole

I basically became obsessed with figuring out how the backend stuff works. Spent way too many late nights staring at obfuscated JavaScript, building deobfuscation tools, and learning more about HLS proxying than any sane person should.

The whole journey is documented on the site's about page if you're into that kind of thing. I wrote it at 4 AM so it reads like a fever dream.

### Why Open Source?

Because I mass-produced poor decisions for 5 months and I need to share the results with someone. Also maybe someone smarter than me can make it better.

### Links

Site and GitHub are in my profile to avoid automod. Check the pinned post.

Happy to answer questions about how any of it works.

## IMPORTANT: Posting Strategy

r/Piracy has strict automod. To avoid removal:

1. **Don't put links in the post body** - Put them in your Reddit profile bio or a pinned post instead
2. **Reference your profile** - Say "links in my profile" or "check my pinned post"
3. **Wait for approval** - Posts sometimes need manual mod approval
4. **Don't edit the post** - Editing can re-trigger automod

## Profile Bio to Set Up First

Set your Reddit profile bio to:

```
Flyx - [YOUR_SITE_URL]
GitHub - [YOUR_GITHUB_URL]
```

Or create a pinned post on your profile with the links.

## Backup: Comment Version

If the post gets through, add this as a first comment:

```
For anyone asking - links are in my profile bio. Didn't want to trigger automod.

The GitHub has full setup instructions if you want to self-host. Runs on Vercel's free tier.
```

## If It Still Gets Removed

1. Message the mods politely asking for manual approval
2. Try posting on a weekend when mods are more active
3. Build some comment karma in r/Piracy first by being helpful on other posts
4. Try the weekly megathread instead of a standalone post
