**Option 1:** "I spent 5 months reverse engineering streaming sites instead of going to therapy. Here's my cry for help (it's open source)"

**Option 2:** "My girlfriend left me so I built a streaming site. She's not coming back but at least I have 4K movies now"

**Option 3:** "I reverse engineered pirate sites so hard I became the final boss. Open source, no ads, works on your mom's iPad"

## Post

Let me tell you about the worst decision I've ever made.

Five months ago, I looked at a pirate streaming site and thought "I bet I could figure out how this works." This is the developer equivalent of saying "I can quit whenever I want" or "I'll just have one more episode."

I could not, in fact, quit whenever I wanted.

### The Descent Into Madness

You know how streaming sites wrap everything in obfuscated JavaScript? Variable names like `_0x4a3f`, strings encoded as character arrays, `eval()` statements that spawn MORE obfuscated code like some kind of digital hydra?

Normal people see that and close the tab. I saw it and said "challenge accepted" like some kind of unhinged 2012 meme.

I have now spent more time staring at minified JavaScript than I have spent with my family. I know what `atob(decodeURIComponent(escape(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, [104,116,116,112]))))` means without running it. This is not a flex. This is a warning.

### What I Built (The Actual Useful Part)

**Flyx** - a streaming site that doesn't want to give your computer an STD:

- 🎬 Movies, TV shows, live TV
- 🚫 Zero ads, zero pop-ups, zero crypto miners trying to heat your room
- 🧹 Clean interface that doesn't look like it was designed by someone having a stroke
- 💸 Runs entirely on free hosting because I'm broke from not touching grass for 5 months
- 📱 Works on mobile, works on desktop, probably works on your smart fridge

No account needed. No email harvesting. No "please disable your adblocker" guilt trips. Just... movies.

### The Technical Crimes I Committed

I basically became a digital archaeologist, except instead of ancient civilizations I was excavating the spaghetti code of people who are themselves stealing content. I robbed the robbers. I pirated the pirates. I became the thing I sought to understand.

Highlights include:
- Building custom deobfuscation tools at 3 AM while questioning my life choices
- Finally cracking a provider's protection only to find they updated it 6 hours later (I may have cried)
- Learning more about CORS headers than any human should know
- Writing documentation at 4 AM that I formatted like an academic paper because sleep deprivation is a hell of a drug

### Why Open Source?

The whole thing is on GitHub because:

1. I spent 5 months on this and if I don't share it I will literally explode
2. The reverse engineering was genuinely interesting and maybe someone can learn from my suffering
3. If you can make it better, please do, I need to go outside

### TL;DR

I mass-produced poor decisions for 5 months and accidentally made something useful. Free streaming, no ads, open source. My therapist is going to have a field day with this one.

Happy to answer questions about how any of it works. I have nothing but time now that I've emerged from my code cave.

## Alternative Shorter Version (if the above is too long)

**Title:** "Built a streaming site because I have no impulse control. No ads, open source, works on your mom's iPad"

**Post:**

5 months ago I decided to reverse engineer how pirate streaming sites work. This was a mistake.

I am now mass-producing poor decisions at an industrial scale, but at least I made something useful:

**Flyx** - streaming that doesn't suck:
- Movies, TV, live TV
- Zero ads, zero pop-ups, zero crypto miners
- Clean interface designed by someone who wasn't having a stroke
- No account needed
- Works on everything

The whole thing is open source because I spent 5 months on this and I need external validation.

I reverse engineered the pirates. I became the final boss. AMA about the technical side if you're curious.

## Notes for posting

- Replace `[YOUR_URL_HERE]` with your live site URL
- Replace `[YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_HERE]` with your GitHub repository link
- The self-deprecating humor tends to do well on Reddit
- The "I have a problem" angle is relatable and disarming
- Shorter version is good if the sub has strict length limits
- Post during peak hours (weekday evenings EST, weekend afternoons)
